# trajectory_distance for python3
=================================

**trajectory_distance** is a Python module for computing distances between 2D-trajectory objects.
It is implemented in Cython.

## Description

9 distances between trajectories are available in the **trajectory_distance**  package.

1. SSPD (Symmetric Segment-Path Distance) [1]
2. OWD  (One-Way Distance) [2]
3. Hausdorff [3]
4. Frechet [4]
5. Discret Frechet [5]
6. DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) [6]
7. LCSS (Longuest Common Subsequence) [7]
8. ERP (Edit distance with Real Penalty) [8]
9. EDR (Edit Distance on Real sequence) [9]

* All distances but *Discret Frechet* and *Discret Frechet* are are available with *Euclidean* or *Spherical* option :
 *  *Euclidean* is based on Euclidean distance between 2D-coordinates.
 *  *Spherical* is based on Haversine distance between 2D-coordinates.

* Grid representation are used to compute the OWD distance. 

* Python implementation is also available in this depository but are not used within `traj_dist.distance` module.

## Dependencies

**trajectory_distance** is tested to work under Python 3.6+ and the following dependencies :
 
* NumPy >= 1.14.0
* Cython >= 0.27.3
* shapely >= 1.6.4
* Geohash ==1.0
* pandas >= 0.20.3
* scipy >=0.19.1
* A working C/C++ compiler.

## Install

This package can be build using `distutils`.

Move to the package directory and run :

```
python setup.py install 
```
to build Cython files. Then run:

```
pip install .
```
to install the package into your environment.

## How to use it

You only need to import the distance module.

```
import traj_dist.distance as tdist
```

All distances are in this module. There are also two extra functions 'cdist', and 'pdist' to compute pairwise distances between all trajectories in a list or two lists. 

Trajectory should be represented as nx2 numpy array. 
See `traj_dist/example.py` file for a small working exemple. 

Some distance requires extra-parameters.
See the help function for more information about how to use each distance.

## Performance

The time required to compute pairwise distance between 100 trajectories (4950 distances), composed from 3 to 20 points (`data/benchmark.csv`) :
